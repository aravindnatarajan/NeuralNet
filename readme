Neural Network code to classify objects into Quasars, White Dwarfs, and Stars.
You need PyBrain to run this code.

code/trainNeuralNetwork.py trains a NN with one hidden layer and 8 neurons.
There are 5 input features: Magnitudes in the u,g,r,i,z bands.
Training is done using data from data/trainingSet.dat
The training file has 7 columns: 5 columns for u,g,r,i,z magnitudes plus redshift (only for quasars) and id (=0 for Q, 1 for W, and 2 for S).

code/testNeuralNetwork.py tests the performance of the NN using data in data/testSet.dat

neuralNetWeights/nn8h.xml contains the weights for the Neural Network.

output/nnObjectClassification.dat contains the results with labels for each column.

graphs/results.pdf shows graphs

Data from the tenth data release of the SDSS
